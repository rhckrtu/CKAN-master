# CKAN policy documents

These exist here and not in the wiki so that:

- We can more easily track changes.
- We can ensure there's peer review before merging.

Right now we have policies on the following:

- [Changing our version comparsion routine](version-comparison.md)
- [Indexing and de-indexing mods](indexing.md)
