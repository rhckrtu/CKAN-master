Requirenments:

There don't seem to be any checks for symlinks. I could create a ZIP with a link in ZIPFOLDER/link that symlinks to /. Then I could have files that are contained in the ZIP that get extracted to ZIPFOLDER/link. This way I can circumvent the checks if the paths contains ".."


// The installation path (install_to field in JSON) cannot contain updirs (ModuleInstallDescriptor.cs L373)
